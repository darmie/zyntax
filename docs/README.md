but are not intended as permanent reference material.

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:
- **Architecture/Design docs**: Place in `docs/` root
- **Language integration docs**: Place in `docs/language-integrations/`
- **Session-specific status**: Place in `docs/session-archive/` (will not be committed)
- **Examples/Tutorials**: Place in `docs/` with descriptive names

Keep documentation:
- **Educational**: Focus on "why" not just "what"
- **Current**: Update when designs change
- **Accessible**: Use clear language and examples
- **Organized**: Follow the structure above
